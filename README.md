# MyReads: A Book Tracking App

## Main Page

This is a book tracking application where the main page consists of three shelves; Currently Reading, Want to Read and Read. User can select and shift the books in any shelves. Furthermore user can make a book disappear from all three shelves, by selecting none.
User can also go to search page.

## Search Page

On search page, through input field, user can search the books and add them to anyof the three shelves.

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
